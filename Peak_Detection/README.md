# Peak Detection

This project focuses on detecting peaks in time series data using the Isolation Forest model.

## Installation

Install the required libraries using the following pip commands:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Data

The project relies on two essential files, `bouts_dict.pkl` and `true_annotations.pkl`, to extract time series information. If you wish to introduce new data, consider modifying these existing files or creating new data with a similar format.

## Usage

### Common Arguments

- `--features`: Specify the features used for peak prediction.
- `--contamination`: Set the contamination value.
- `--grouped_range`: Define the range for peak grouping (e.g., 60 corresponds to a range of -30 to +30).
- `--add_golay`: Include Golay filters for `pose.thor_post_x` and `pose.thor_post_y` features.
- `--add_mv_stats`: Add moving averages and standard deviations for the `distance.origin-prob` feature.

### Predicting Plots

1. Prepare a text file (you can refer to `fly_experiment.txt`) containing fly names and corresponding experiment IDs in the format:

```
Fly05182022_5d -- 0
Fly06072022_5d -- 16
```

2. Generate peak prediction plots using the following command, saving them in the `peak_plots_output` folder. Note that the `fly_experiments_fn` argument is specific to `plot_peaks.py`.

```bash
python plot_peaks.py --fly_experiments_fn your_filename.txt
```

### Evaluating Model Predictions

1. Evaluate model predictions on the data in the `bouts_dict.pkl` file, considering only those instances with true annotations in `true_annotations.pkl`. Use the following command:

```bash
python evaluate_predictions.py --features distance.origin-prob distance.head-prob pose.prob_x pose.prob_y --contamination 0.04 --grouped_range 60 --add_golay --add_mv_stats
```

2. I recommend avoiding the addition of Golay filters and moving statistics, as these tend to decrease the overall performance of the model.
